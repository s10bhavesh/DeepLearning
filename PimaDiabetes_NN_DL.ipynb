**Define Model**\n","* Models in Keras are defined as a sequence of layers. We create a Sequential model and add layers one at a time until we are happy with our network topology. \n","\n","* The first thing to get right is to ensure the input layer has the right number of inputs. This can be specified when creating the first layer with the input dim argument and setting it to 8 for the 8 input variables. \n","\n","* How do we know the number of layers to use and their types? This is a very hard question. There are heuristics that we can use and often the best network structure is found through a process of trial and error experimentation. Generally, you need a network large enough to capture the structure of the problem if that helps at all. In this example we will use a fully-connected network structure with three layers.\n","\n","* Fully connected layers are defined using the Dense class. We can specify the number of neurons in the layer as the first argument and specify the activation function using the activation argument. We will use the REctified Linear Unit (RELU) activation function on the first two layers and the sigmoid activation function in the output layer. It used to be the case that sigmoid and tanh activation functions were preferred for all layers. These days, better performance is seen using the rectifier activation function. We use a sigmoid activation function on the output layer to ensure our network output is between 0 and 1 and easy to map to either a probability of class 1 or snap to a hard classification of either class with a default threshold of 0.5. \n","\n","* We can piece it all together by adding each layer. The first hidden layer has 12 neurons and expects 8 input variables (e.g. input dim=8). The second hidden layer has 8 neurons and finally the output layer has 1 neuron to predict the class (onset of diabetes or not)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"D2nZ-AYdKgPz","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1592835187625,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8439,"user":{"displayName":"BHAVESH SONWANI","photoUrl":"","userId":"04650862282455408788"}}},"source":["# create model\n","model = Sequential()\n","model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))\n","model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))\n","model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))"],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"WirEb2ns4E3c","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cmQOW3wRWD1u","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#**Compile Model**\n","\n","* Now that the model is defined, we can compile it. \n","* Compiling the model uses the efficient numerical libraries under the covers (the so-called backend) such as Theano or TensorFlow.

For example k-fold cross-validation is often used with 5 or 10 folds. As such, 5 or 10 models must be constructed and evaluated, greatly adding to the evaluation time of a model. Nevertheless, when the problem is small enough or if you have sufficient compute resources, k-fold cross-validation can give you a less biased estimate of the performance of your\n","model.\n","\n","In the example below we use the StratifiedKFold class from the scikit-learn Python machine learning library to split up the training dataset into 10 folds. The folds are stratified, meaning that the algorithm attempts to balance the number of instances of each class in each fold. The example creates and evaluates 10 models using the 10 splits of the data and collects all of the scores."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QlVlp714ly3y","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1582493708532,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1165,"user":{"displayName":"Rituraj Kushwaha","photoUrl":"","userId":"09710585958359078597"}},"outputId":"59879415-58af-4cf2-e386-13bb0d64f785"},"source":["from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\n","\n","print(StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=7))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, random_state=7, shuffle=True)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"3lO9GvUGGvgl","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1582494118691,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":331261,"user":{"displayName":"Rituraj Kushwaha","photoUrl":"","userId":"09710585958359078597"}},"outputId":"76c75926-0f68-4e78-ef6b-2f562eb6955a"},"source":["# MLP for Pima Indians Dataset with 10-fold cross validation\n","from keras.models import Sequential\n","from keras.layers import Dense\n","from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\n","import numpy\n","\n","# fix random seed for reproducibility\n","seed = 7\n","numpy.random.seed(seed)\n","\n","# load pima indians dataset\n","dataset = numpy.loadtxt(\"pima-indians-diabetes.csv\", delimiter=\",\")\n","\n","# split into input (X) and output (Y) variables\n","X = dataset[:,0:8]\n","Y = dataset[:,8]\n","\n","# define 10-fold cross validation test harness\n","kfold = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=seed)\n","cvscores = []\n","for train, test in kfold.split(X, Y):\n","    # create model\n","    model = Sequential()\n","    model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))\n","    model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))\n","    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n","    \n","    # Compile model\n","    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n","    \n","    # Fit the model\n","    model.fit(X[train], Y[train], epochs=150, batch_size=10, verbose=0)\n","    \n","    # evaluate the model\n","    scores = model.evaluate(X[test], Y[test], verbose=0)\n","    print(\"%s: %.2f%%\" % (model.metrics_names[1], scores[1]*100))\n","    cvscores.append(scores[1] * 100)\n","\n","print(\"%.2f%% (+/- %.2f%%)\" % (numpy.mean(cvscores), numpy.std(cvscores)))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["acc: 77.92%\n","acc: 79.22%\n","acc: 68.83%\n","acc: 67.53%\n","acc: 71.43%\n","acc: 64.94%\n","acc: 64.94%\n","acc: 75.32%\n","acc: 71.05%\n","acc: 77.63%\n","71.88% (+/- 5.11%)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Y8oP8JOVHyk2","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
